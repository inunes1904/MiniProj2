# TASK

Phases of the task:

1.) Each student must read the shared resources to consolidate their JavaScript knowledge, and understand the structure of the shared code, the set of functionalities related to user iteration. For this phase of the task to be considered finished you must have the font-end fully functional.

2.) Each student must implement the new entities planned in task 3.1, with all the planned functionalities.  

3.) Each student must explore the API that will be the basis for requests to manage the information provided: http://fcawebbook2.herokuapp.com/, as well as communication with the web server via native APIs and libraries, which are typically JSON-based.

4.) All the files developed must be submitted on the Git platform, in each student's individual account. The project in Git should be called MiniProj2. The project will be evaluated using the files in Git.

5.) You must contribute to the general debate by commenting and giving your opinion (in a sustained manner, as in the previous points) on your colleagues' interventions, and by supporting your colleagues in resolving their doubts, using the task forum for this purpose.
